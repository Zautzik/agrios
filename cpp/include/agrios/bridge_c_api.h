/* Plain-C ABI over two independent shared-memory channels:
 *   - the pose bridge:      SharedRingBuffer<Pose6D, kBridgeCapacity>
 *   - the joint telemetry:  SharedRingBuffer<JointState6, kJointTelemetryCapacity>
 * See bridge_config.hpp for their names/capacities and pose6d.hpp /
 * joint_state.hpp for the payload layouts.
 *
 * Why this exists instead of letting Python poke the shared-memory bytes
 * directly: push()/pop()'s correctness depends on real acquire/release
 * memory fences, not just on reading/writing the right bytes at the right
 * offsets. Python's struct/ctypes modules have no memory-order-aware atomic
 * primitives, and a naive load/store would only happen to work by accident
 * on x86-64 (whose strong memory model papers over the missing fences) --
 * it would be a real, silent bug on a weakly-ordered target like the
 * ARM64 Jetson/Raspberry Pi boards this bridge is meant to eventually run
 * motor control on. Routing Python through this compiled shim means both
 * languages execute the exact same std::atomic operations, so there's one
 * implementation of the protocol, not two that have to be kept in sync by
 * hand.
 *
 * Two channels, two small sets of near-identical functions rather than one
 * generic void*-based API: the C ABI can't carry a template parameter, and a
 * type-erased API would trade compile-time payload-type safety for avoiding
 * ~15 lines of duplication. Not worth it for two types.
